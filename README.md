## Overview

An attempt to quantify bias and framing in the media.

Bias here means a consistent adherence to a perspective. Having more bias is demonstrated through more adherence and a less negotiated stance.

Framing here means intentionally representing an event or idea. There are a number of quantifiable forms of framing:

  * size: Amount of screen-real estate used along with its duration.
  * place: Location and frequency of placement of detail or fact within the body of a work.
  * word: The sentiments of adjectives and verbs used.
  * context: The density of references to prior events.
  * amplitude: Location and number of clicks to get to the content.

The theory is being able to reliably quantify these things can lead to a predictive model of media coverage based on analysis of an existing corpus.

The magnitude of a news event is the computed deviation of its coverage from the predicted model.


## Rationale

The two dominant media classification vectors of truthfulness and political bias are both coarse and inaccurately  decreed from a single opinion or crowdsourced.

Even a two-dimensional [political compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_compass) model is insufficient because it relies on stances to be bucketed into that system and correlated with other stances in the bucket.

A more accurate model would depict an enumeration of perspectives on a specific event or idea and a commitment level to such a perspective. 

This approach permits for both predictive entanglement and disintanglement.
